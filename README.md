# Machine-Learning-Final-project
The goal of this project is to create a churn prediction system for a well-known telecommunications company. 
Our goal is to analyse past customer data using data analytics and machine learning to find trends and signals that point to possible churn behavior. 
With the help of this predictive model, the company may reach out to at-risk clients in a proactive manner and offer tailored retention methods to reduce churn rates.
The telecommunications brand can obtain a competitive edge by improving customer retention and loyalty by successfully adopting a churn prediction system. 
The brand will also be able to better understand client preferences, problems, and behaviour thanks to the data gained from this project, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and enhanced customer support.
In the end, the project's successful completion will show the importance of data-driven decision-making and how it will significantly influence the development of customer-centric strategies in the telecom sector. The brand can cultivate long-lasting customer relationships and ensure sustainable growth and ongoing success in a market that is constantly changing by taking a proactive approach to churn prediction and retention.
